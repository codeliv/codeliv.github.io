									<h4>Cover Letter</h4>
									<p>Dear recruiter;<br>
										


									<br>I am very excited about this opportunity, would love to hear and discuss more.<br>
										<br>I have 11+ years of experience blending Customer Success / Support and project management. 4 of those, leading Global teams.<br>
										<br>Being always result-oriented, meeting or exceeding metrics expected, looking continuously for improvement. I consider myself very analytical (facts and data always drive me before the intuition), use to handle multiple projects at once, and being able to solve in the best way possible. Into the SaaS industry for most of my career.<br>
										<br>Account Management, solving any issues they had, making sure we were providing all contractual agreements as they needed is part of my tasks and what I am used to getting done. Also responsible for following up the SOW (statements of work), is the bridge between the customer and the company.<br>
										<br>Something about me: I lead a healthy lifestyle. During my free time, I like to travel (to dive or skydive), play the piano, and travel to run marathons and half marathons. What I've learned during my entire working life is that connections are worth much more than money and my family is the biggest asset I have in my life. <br>
										<br>I am really excited about this opportunity. I’ve heard great feedback about the company and what I researched online also made my eyes shine. <br>


										Please feel free to reach anytime for any questions or interview, and, I am looking forward to hearing back from you.<br>
										<br>
										With best regards,<br>
										<br>
										Livia Abreu

														<br><p>To whom it may concern:</br>
	

	<br>My name is Isabel de la Paz and I have known Livia Abreu for two years. She worked at Pagero as a Team Leader in our office at Pagero, where I am the Sales Manager. Previous to this position, I was a member of her team working as a support agent, so I know very well how it is to be part of her team.</br>
	

	<br>I am writing to recommend Livia for your company. In all my years of experience, some people stand out for their great qualities and Livia is one of those people. She is well known for her qualities such as: intelligence, work ethic, positive attitude, teamwork mentality, leadership, diligence and so many more great things. She was well respected throughout the organization for all the hard work and hours she put in to the job daily. Throughout the time I've know her, she has always shown me that she is a positive, motivated leader with amazing potential.</br>
	

	<br>During her time here, she played an important role in launching the customer service department. She started with hiring the new members for the support team, training us and transmitting the values of the company.</br>
	

	<br>In summary, due to her great attitude, dedication and excellent potential, I would heartily recommend that you accept Livia for the management role. I´m sure that she would not let you down and would be as great an asset to your team as she has been to us.</br>
	

	<br>Please don't hesitate in contacting me if I can be of further assistance.</br></h6>.</p>
