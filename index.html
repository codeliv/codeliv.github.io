	<br>My name is Isabel de la Paz and I have known Livia Abreu for two years. She worked at Pagero as a Team Leader in our office at Pagero, where I am the Sales Manager. Previous to this position, I was a member of her team working as a support agent, so I know very well how it is to be part of her team.</br>
	

	<br>I am writing to recommend Livia for your company. In all my years of experience, some people stand out for their great qualities and Livia is one of those people. She is well known for her qualities such as: intelligence, work ethic, positive attitude, teamwork mentality, leadership, diligence and so many more great things. She was well respected throughout the organization for all the hard work and hours she put in to the job daily. Throughout the time I've know her, she has always shown me that she is a positive, motivated leader with amazing potential.</br>
	

	<br>During her time here, she played an important role in launching the customer service department. She started with hiring the new members for the support team, training us and transmitting the values of the company.</br>
	

	<br>In summary, due to her great attitude, dedication and excellent potential, I would heartily recommend that you accept Livia for the management role. I´m sure that she would not let you down and would be as great an asset to your team as she has been to us.</br>
